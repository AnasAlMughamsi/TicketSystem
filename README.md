# Ticket System - Project Assignment:

### About the Ticket System project
Ticket system is simple project for creating CURD (create, update, read and delete) for both the user model and ticket model.

I used the following library: -
- Node.js for bulding the project.    
- TypeScript for set up the project.
- Exprees.Js for budling APIs.
- Mongoose for database.


## Quick Start
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnasAlMughamsi/TicketSystem.git

# Go inside the directory
cd TicketSystem

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
nodemon src/index.ts
```



## Documentation
Folder Structure
All the server source code will be inside src directory. Inside src, there will be: -
- controllers
- models
- routes
- index.ts

### Nodemon
Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in the server source code and it automatically restart the server. 

### Express
Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build our backend API's.

### Mongoose
Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It also provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data
