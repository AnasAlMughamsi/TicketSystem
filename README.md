# TicketSystem

### About the Ticket System project
Ticket system is simple project for creating CURD (create, update, read and delete) for both the user model and ticket model.

I used the following: -
- Exprees.Js for buling an API
- Mongoose for database
- TypeScript for set up the project


#### Running Project
please run npm install, once you install it types nodemon src/index.ts to run the projcet.
