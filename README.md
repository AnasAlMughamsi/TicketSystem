# TicketSystem

### About the Ticket System project
Ticket system is simple project for creating CURD (create, update, read and delete) for both the user model and ticket model.

I used the following library: -
- Exprees.Js for budling an API
- Mongoose for database
- TypeScript for set up the project


#### Running Project
Please type `npm start` to install the dependencies. 
Once it is done, type `nodemon src/index.ts` to start the project
